# Fatigue-Dataset

The dataset was collected from the MatNavi database of National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS) of
Japan. MatNavi is one of the world largest material databases, including polymer, ceramics, alloys, electronic
structure, superconducting materials, composite and diffusion database. Here, a dataset of 437 metal fatigue strengths
with different type of metals were collected, including carbon steel and low alloy steel, carburizing steel and
spring steel, etc., under different test conditions such as ingredients, technological processing of upstream rolled
production characteristics and downstream heat treatment. 21 features were used for the target property of metal
fatigue strength. The features are attributes of the selected alloy steels and post-processing technology, including
processing parameters (NT, THT, THQCr, CT, DT, Dt, QmT, TT, TCr, Ct, Tt, THt) and composition parameters
(C, Si, Mn, P, S, Ni, Cr, Cu, Mo).
